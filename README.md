# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. One player uses X and the other uses O. Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square. The goal is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all 9 squares are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.
